      So, my name is Sabrina, and I'm on a mission to educate while learning something new myself. My hopes with this is
      to let people really get in to the free thinking idea of trying something new, educating themselves, making an impact,
      and taking a leap.

  <h3>Why are pollinators important?</h3>
  <p>
    Pollinators are responsible for majority of our food production as well as maintain our ecosystems by helping our plants reproduce!
  </p>
  <h3>Who are our pollinators?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Our most common pollinators are bees, birds, butterflies, and bats. But we also have pollinators such as ants, beetles, flies, and moths.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Mission to help our pollinators!
  </h3>
  <p>
    We have to help our natural pollinators in order to get them to help us out! They're resources are steadily declining with the development of urban areas and the strong use of pesticides, 
    most areas are also low on
    the food map, creating really dire food deserts, making it difficult for those in low-income situations to have steady and reliable sources 
    of food. So let's combat the growing food deserts by teaching our communitites how to feed our pollinators and how to feed themselves! 
    Most urban areas have at least a small area with natural lighting and fresh air. So let's do our part and get involved with our ecosystem
    and help our pollinators out and create more sustainable lifestyles for ourselves and our families.
