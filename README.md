# bring-on-the-bees

      So I am creating my project in order to provide an easy place for people to find information on how to start home gardening in order to fill the gap in food deserts, specifically in urban areas. In order to do that we have to feed our pollinators, so it's also going to include the general beautification of your yard or space in order to benefit the ecosystem around you, but also have a yard that takes minimal maintenace and also helps itself full-circle into self-pollinating harvested items. Gardening has always been a passion and growing up in the urban area of Louisville my family was lucky enough to be versed in it due to pure need. I would eventually like to work this in to a small nonprofit for Louisville locals to come and learn as well as help bridge the gap of food deserts with community gardening.
      But for now as my front-page I have placed a few quick-tips as well as Kentucky native and pollinator friendly plants in CSS cards that are arranged by a CSS grid, so they are responsive and change column sizes as the screen increases/decreases. I have included a image slider that uses Javascript to work the buttons as well as the dots are interactive and can be clicked to move the images as well. My navigation bar includes a hamburger button when in mobile and tablet sizes.
